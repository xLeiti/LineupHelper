# LineupHelper
Test flashbangs without going blind.

In cs2 there are two different grenade trajectory previews:
- a yellow one, which is inaccurat since it stops before the detonation point
- a red one, which is accurate, but comes with the landings spot PIP and fades away very quickly.

This cfg adds an toggle bind which allows the red grenade trajectory preview to stay infinite.
It can be used to check which spots are affected by flashbangs without going blind.

Default bind for the toggle is ```i```

How to use: 
1. search for an lineup
2. toggle the LineupHelper on before throwing the flash
3. the red trajectory preview stays until another grenade is thrown or the LineupHelper is toggled off

Note: the flash pops where the line ends, not the dot within the circle!
